"Drunken Dealer"-The dealer is looking thirsty! Take a sip for each player in the game!
"Eye For An Eye"- The dealer rolls the dice and gives an amount of sips equals to the amount of eyes to a player. The dealer drinks the same amount.
"Gimme' A Break"- The player with the lowest score gets a free pass next time 'a drink is needed'.
"Come At Me, Bro!"- The player with the highest score has to drink twice as much next round. Yeah, nobody likes you.
"Worship Me"-Get 10 sips to give out. Suddenly everyone likes you. Funny, eh?
-
"Cheers!"
Everybody takes a sip (or 2, but who really cares).
-
"Lady Luck, Take The Wheel!"
The dealer rolls the dice. If the dice hits 6, everybody BUT the dealer drinks 3 sips. If it doesn't, dealer drinks 3 sips.
-
"A Score To Settle"
The player with the highest score has to chug the rest of his/her/their/its drink. Not so cool being on top now?
-
"Simon Says: DRINK!"
Dealer is Simon, do as he says, first to fuck up drinks 3 sips. Imagine not being able to follow instructions lmao.
-
"No! I Mean Yes!?"
Dealer picks a player. The player can't say no for the next 3 rounds. It would be a shame if that were to be abused.
-
”Woof”
Pick an animal. Everybody BUT you must imitate the sound the animal makes. The worst person at imitating takes a shot.
-
“WATERFALL!”
Yep its time, get your drink and start chuggin. All players start drinking their beverage at the same time. No player can stop drinking until the player to their left stops. But you already knew that.
-
“Height Matters”
Everybody who is shorter than you drinks 5 sips. BUT but height doesn’t matter… HERE IT DOES!
-
“One In The Chamber”
Dealer get your fingergun, and shoot another player. That player now must chug their drink. This power can be used 1 time, but you can save it throughout the game. Use it when you feel like it.
-
“Extreme Category”
Yep, it’s a category, Dealer chooses the category and everybody takes turns naming something within the category.
HOWEVER, since it's extreme we have 8 sips on the line for the person who fails to name something with in the category!
